4. **Loading Circle Styles:**
   - The loading circles (`div > div`) have a circular shape, a specific background color, and some margin for spacing.
   - The `animation` property is used to create a loading animation effect. The circles move up and down alternately with a duration of 1 second.

5. **Animation Delay:**
   - The `animation-delay` property is used to create a delay for each circle, creating a sequential loading effect.

6. **Keyframes for Loading Animation:**
